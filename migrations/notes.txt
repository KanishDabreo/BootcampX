1. CREATE A DATABASE
-Create a database called bootcampx
  -CREATE DATABASE bootcampx; (-- Create the database)
  -\c bootcampx; (-- Start using the database)

2. CREATE TABLES
-Create a folder called migrations within the BootcampX folder.
-Inside migrations, create a new file called students_cohorts.sql
-Take a moment to try writing the CREATE TABLE statements yourself for students and cohorts. Use the ERD to help.
-Once you've given it a try, toggle the code block below to reveal our version of the code.
-Make sure the code in your students_cohorts.sql file is identical to the code below.

ex. students_cohorts.sql file(--each represents a column)
  CREATE TABLE cohorts (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  start_date DATE,
  end_date DATE
);

CREATE TABLE students (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(255),
  phone VARCHAR(32),
  github VARCHAR(255),
  start_date DATE,
  end_date DATE,
  cohort_id INTEGER REFERENCES cohorts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

3. Add the tables to the database
- From your psql session, type \i migrations/students_cohorts.sql
-Now enter \dt into your psql session to make sure the two tables have been created.

4. Create a New SQL File
Create a new directory in BootcampX called 0_selects.Name the file whatever you like, but adding a number at the beginning can help organize. A good name for this requirement might be 1_students_without_github.sql. Then write the query inside this file.
ex.
SELECT id, name, email, cohort_id
FROM students
WHERE github IS NULL
ORDER BY cohort_id

5.Execute The Query
-Make sure you're in a psql session.
-Execute psql from, the BootcampX directory.
-Make sure you're using the bootcampx database \c bootcampx
-Execute the query with the following command:
\i 0_selects/1_students_without_github.sql


5a. TO Add the tables to the database.

-From psql, type \i migrations/assignments_submissions.sql
-Now enter \dt into your psqlsession to make sure the two tables have been created.
